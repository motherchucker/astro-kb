Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 47 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. Certain species of Spathiphyllum are commonly known as spath or peace lilies.

## Description

Spathiphyllum is a genus of herbaceous evergreen plants with dark green foliage that can reach 1 to 6 feet (0.30 to 1.83 m) in height. Rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves emerge directly from a low-lying or underground creeping stem. The leaves are elliptical or lanceolate, 4 to 25 inches (10 to 64 cm) long and 1 to 10 inches (2.5 to 25.4 cm) wide. They are supported on shoots (petioles) of shorter or similar length to the leaf.

The flowering structure rises above the foliage, with a single white or greenish-white spathe (a specialized leaf associated with the flower) partially surrounding the flower structure. The spathe is elliptical or lanceolate, and 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) long. It surrounds the spadix (a short fleshy structure that contains the male and female flower parts), which is greenish-white or cream in color, and shorter than the surrounding spathe. The spadix is covered in equal-sized flowers that contain both the male and female reproductive parts. All Spathiphyllum flowers on a given spadix mature at the same time, and produce pollen for up to four days. Pollinated flowers produce ovoid fruits that mature over four to six months, each containing up to eight seeds.

## Ecology and distribution

Members of Spathiphyllum are widespread in Central America and northern South America. Two species are found on Pacific islands: one on Cocos Island (S. laeve) and one in Indonesia and the Philippines (S. commutatum). They grow on the forest floors of tropical humid forests, in shady, moist or wet areas along rivers and streams, in river valleys and foothills. They often grow in colonies along waterways, and can be in places periodically inundated with water.
